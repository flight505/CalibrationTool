Looking at your STL file and spreadsheet, I understand perfectly! The cube is cleverly designed with:
- Single walls (0.4mm) at the top section for fine measurement
- Triple walls (1.2mm) at the bottom section for more robust measurement
- A divider creating this stepped wall thickness

This dual-measurement approach provides better calibration accuracy by testing both thin and thick wall extrusion in a single print. Let me create a comprehensive React app for this calibration process.I've created a comprehensive React app for Orca Slicer flow calibration that understands your dual-wall cube design perfectly! Here's what makes it special:

## Key Features:

1. **Dual Measurement System**: 
   - Single wall (0.4mm) measurements for fine calibration
   - Triple wall (1.2mm) measurements for robust validation
   - Averages both for optimal accuracy

2. **Smart Calculations**:
   - Uses your exact formula from the spreadsheet
   - Handles partial measurements (you don't need all 8)
   - Shows individual and combined flow percentages

3. **Visual Guidance**:
   - Interactive diagram showing where to measure
   - Color-coded sections (blue for single, yellow for triple)
   - Clear measurement targets based on nozzle size

4. **User-Friendly Workflow**:
   - Step-by-step instructions built-in
   - Collapsible instruction panel
   - Export results for record keeping
   - Reset function for multiple tests

5. **Dynamic Adaptation**:
   - Automatically adjusts targets for different nozzle sizes
   - Scales calculations appropriately
   - Works with any starting flow rate

The app implements the exact methodology from your spreadsheet but makes it much more accessible. The dual-wall approach is brilliant because it tests both precision (single wall) and consistency (triple wall) in one print.

Would you like me to expand this into a complete filament profile calibration suite that includes:
- Temperature tower analyzer
- Pressure advance calculator
- Retraction test manager
- Complete profile generator for Orca Slicer
- Multi-filament comparison tool
- Calibration history tracker

This could become a comprehensive calibration workflow manager that guides users through the entire process methodically!
