## Recommended Calibration Order

According to OrcaSlicer documentation, calibrations should be performed in this specific order for best results:

1. **E-steps/Rotation Distance** - Fundamental extruder calibration (if not already done)
2. **Z-offset** - First layer calibration (if not already done)
3. **Temperature Tower** - Find optimal nozzle temperature
4. **Flow Rate** - Calibrate extrusion multiplier (already in table)
5. **Pressure Advance** - Optimize corner quality (already in table)
6. **Retraction** - Minimize stringing (already in table)
7. **Tolerance Test** - Check dimensional accuracy
8. **Max Volumetric Speed** - Find flow limits (already in table)
9. **Cornering/Junction Deviation** - Optimize corner speeds
10. **VFA Speed Test** - Find resonance-free speeds
11. **Input Shaping** - Advanced vibration compensation (if supported)

## Important Notes

- Always create a new project after completing calibration tests to exit calibration mode
- Calibration values are material and sometimes nozzle-specific
- Document your calibration results for each filament type/brand
- Re-calibrate when changing hardware or experiencing quality issues
- Some tests require specific conditions (e.g., high acceleration for cornering test)
