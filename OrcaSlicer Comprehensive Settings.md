# OrcaSlicer Comprehensive Settings Recommendations

## Printer Settings

| Setting | Recommended Value | Notes | Example | Reference |
|---------|------------------|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Machine Limits** |  |  |  |  |
| Max Print Speed X/Y | 200-500mm/s | Controls maximum feedrate for printing moves. Higher values enable faster printing but require rigid frames and proper acceleration tuning. CoreXY printers handle higher speeds better than Cartesian. | X1C: 500mm/s, Ender3: 200mm/s | https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/wiki |
| Max Print Speed Z | 4-10mm/s | Z-axis speed affects layer adhesion and print quality. Too fast causes layer separation, too slow wastes time. Most printers are mechanically limited by Z-axis design. | Most printers: 5mm/s | https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/wiki |
| Travel Speed | 120-200mm/s | Speed during non-printing moves. Higher speeds reduce print time but may cause ringing/ghosting if printer can't handle rapid direction changes. Balance with acceleration settings. | CoreXY: 200mm/s, Cartesian: 150mm/s | https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/wiki |
| **Acceleration Settings** |  |  |  |  |
| Normal Printing Accel | 2000-4000mm/s² | Primary acceleration for most print moves. Higher values reduce print time but may cause ringing, layer shifting, or poor surface quality. Start conservative and increase gradually. | X1C: 3000mm/s², Ender3: 1000mm/s² | https://www.obico.io/blog/orcaslicer-comprehensive-calibration-guide/ |
| Outer Wall Accel | 1000-2000mm/s² | Lower acceleration for visible surfaces ensures smooth finish. This is the most critical setting for surface quality - too high causes visible artifacts and dimensional inaccuracy. | Most printers: 1500mm/s² | https://www.obico.io/blog/orcaslicer-comprehensive-calibration-guide/ |
| Inner Wall Accel | 3000-8000mm/s² | Inner walls aren't visible so can use higher acceleration for speed. Should be 2-3x outer wall acceleration. Affects overall print strength and dimensional accuracy. | Direct drive: 5000mm/s² | https://www.obico.io/blog/orcaslicer-comprehensive-calibration-guide/ |
| First Layer Accel | 300-500mm/s² | Conservative acceleration for bed adhesion. Too high causes layer shifting or poor adhesion. Critical for print success - failed first layer ruins entire print. | All printers: 400mm/s² | https://www.obico.io/blog/orcaslicer-comprehensive-calibration-guide/ |
| **Jerk Settings** |  |  |  |  |
| XY Jerk | 8-20mm/s | Instantaneous velocity change without acceleration phase. Higher values enable sharper corners but cause ringing/ghosting. Tune with acceleration for optimal balance. | Enclosed: 15mm/s, Open: 10mm/s | https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/wiki/speed_settings_jerk_xy |
| Outer Wall Jerk | 6-9mm/s | Lower jerk for smooth corner transitions on visible surfaces. Too high creates corner bulging and surface artifacts. Most important for print quality on detailed parts. | Quality prints: 7mm/s | https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/wiki/speed_settings_jerk_xy |
| **Extruder Configuration** |  |  |  |  |
| Pressure Advance | 0.02-0.8 | Compensates for nozzle pressure lag during speed changes. Eliminates bulging at corners and gaps on direction changes. Direct drive systems need less due to shorter filament path. Calibrate per filament type. | BMG Direct: 0.05, Bowden: 0.4 | https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/wiki/adaptive-pressure-advance |
| Retraction Length | 0.2-6mm | Distance filament pulls back to prevent stringing. Direct drive needs less due to short path to nozzle. Bowden systems need more to overcome tube compression. Too much causes gaps, too little causes stringing. | Direct: 0.8mm, Bowden: 4mm | https://www.obico.io/blog/retraction-test-in-orcaslicer-a-comprehensive-guide/ |
| Retraction Speed | 20-60mm/s | Speed of filament retraction. Too fast can strip flexible filaments or cause extruder skipping. Too slow allows stringing during travel moves. Material dependent - flexible needs slower speeds. | PLA: 45mm/s, TPU: 25mm/s | https://www.obico.io/blog/retraction-test-in-orcaslicer-a-comprehensive-guide/ |
| Z-Hop Height | 0.1-0.4mm | Lifts nozzle during travel moves to avoid hitting printed parts. Essential for complex prints with overhangs. Too low still causes collisions, too high wastes time and may cause oozing. | 0.2mm for most prints | https://www.obico.io/blog/z-hop-in-orca-slicer-the-secret-to-perfect-3d-prints/ |

## Filament Settings

| Setting | Recommended Value | Notes | Example | Reference |
|---------|------------------|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Temperature Control** |  |  |  |  |
| Nozzle Temp PLA | 190-220°C | Lower temps reduce stringing but may cause under-extrusion. Higher temps improve layer adhesion but increase oozing. Use temperature towers to find optimal balance for each filament brand. | eSUN PLA+: 210°C | https://www.obico.io/blog/temperature-tower-test-orcaslicer-comprehensive-guide/ |
| Nozzle Temp PETG | 230-250°C | PETG requires higher temps than PLA for proper flow. Too low causes layer delamination and poor surface finish. Too high increases stringing and thermal degradation. | Overture PETG: 240°C | https://www.obico.io/blog/temperature-tower-test-orcaslicer-comprehensive-guide/ |
| Nozzle Temp ABS/ASA | 230-260°C | High temperature plastics requiring enclosed chambers for best results. Temperature affects layer adhesion, warping tendency, and surface finish. ASA typically runs 5-10°C higher than ABS. | ABS: 245°C | https://www.obico.io/blog/temperature-tower-test-orcaslicer-comprehensive-guide/ |
| First Layer Temp | +5-10°C above normal | Higher first layer temperature improves bed adhesion by making plastic more fluid. Critical for preventing warping and ensuring good layer bonding to build surface. | PLA: 215°C if normal is 210°C | https://www.obico.io/blog/temperature-tower-test-orcaslicer-comprehensive-guide/ |
| Bed Temp PLA | 50-60°C | PLA has minimal warping so moderate bed temps sufficient. Glass beds need higher temps than PEI. Too high can cause elephant foot or poor part removal. | Glass bed: 60°C, PEI: 50°C | https://orca-slicer.org/how-to-set-bed-temperature-in-orca-slicer/ |
| Bed Temp PETG | 70-80°C | PETG requires higher bed temps for proper adhesion. Too low causes warping and poor first layer. PETG bonds strongly to many surfaces - use release agent if needed. | Most beds: 75°C | https://orca-slicer.org/how-to-set-bed-temperature-in-orca-slicer/ |
| Bed Temp ABS/ASA | 90-110°C | High bed temps essential for preventing warping in large ABS prints. Enclosed chambers help maintain consistent temperature. Consider thermal expansion of bed surface. | Enclosed: 100°C | https://orca-slicer.org/how-to-set-bed-temperature-in-orca-slicer/ |
| **Cooling Configuration** |  |  |  |  |
| Fan Speed PLA | 80-100% | PLA benefits from aggressive cooling to prevent overheating and improve bridging. Maximum cooling after first layer. Reduces stringing and improves overhangs significantly. | Layer 2+: 100% | https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/software/bambu-studio/auto-cooling |
| Fan Speed PETG | 30-50% | Moderate cooling prevents layer adhesion issues while controlling stringing. Too much cooling causes poor layer bonding and warping. Balance quality vs strength. | Layer 3+: 40% | https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/software/bambu-studio/auto-cooling |
| Fan Speed ABS/ASA | 0-20% | Minimal cooling to prevent warping and layer delamination. Enclosed printers can use slightly more cooling. Focus on chamber temperature control instead. | Enclosed: 0%, Open: 15% | https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/software/bambu-studio/auto-cooling |
| First Layer Fan | 0% | Always disable cooling for first layer to ensure proper bed adhesion. Any cooling can cause warping, layer separation, or poor surface bonding for all materials. | All materials: 0% | https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/software/bambu-studio/auto-cooling |
| Overhang Fan Speed | 80-100% | Automatic fan speed increase for steep overhangs improves print quality. OrcaSlicer detects overhang angles and adjusts cooling accordingly. Critical for bridging success. | >50° overhang: 100% | https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/software/bambu-studio/auto-cooling |
| **Flow and Extrusion** |  |  |  |  |
| Flow Ratio | 0.95-1.05 | Multiplier for extrusion amount. Calibrate using flow rate test prints. Too high causes over-extrusion and poor surface quality. Too low causes gaps and weak parts. Material and nozzle dependent. | Start: 1.0, tune via calibration | https://www.obico.io/blog/flow-rate-calibration-orca-slicer-comprehensive-guide/ |
| Max Volumetric Speed PLA | 12-16mm³/s | Maximum plastic flow rate to prevent under-extrusion. Depends on hotend capability and nozzle size. Exceeding limit causes gaps and poor quality. Higher for larger nozzles. | 0.4mm nozzle: 15mm³/s | https://www.obico.io/blog/maximum-volumetric-speed-test-in-orcaslicer-a-comprehensive-guide/ |
| Max Volumetric Speed ABS | 8-12mm³/s | ABS requires more heat to melt properly, limiting flow rate. Conservative values prevent under-extrusion at high speeds. Critical for maintaining quality in speed prints. | 0.4mm nozzle: 11mm³/s | https://www.obico.io/blog/maximum-volumetric-speed-test-in-orcaslicer-a-comprehensive-guide/ |
| Max Volumetric Speed PETG | 6-10mm³/s | PETG has highest melt temperature requirement, limiting flow rate most. Essential setting for preventing under-extrusion during fast printing or thick layers. | 0.4mm nozzle: 8mm³/s | https://www.obico.io/blog/maximum-volumetric-speed-test-in-orcaslicer-a-comprehensive-guide/ |

## Process Settings

| Setting | Recommended Value | Notes | Example | Reference |
|---------|------------------|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Quality Settings** |  |  |  |  |
| Layer Height | 0.1-0.3mm | Fundamental quality vs speed tradeoff. Smaller layers give finer detail but longer print times. Limited by nozzle diameter - typically 25-75% of nozzle width for best results. | Detail: 0.12mm, Draft: 0.28mm | https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/wiki/quality_settings_layer_height |
| First Layer Height | 0.2-0.25mm | Slightly thicker first layer improves bed adhesion and compensates for bed irregularities. Too thick causes elephant foot, too thin causes poor adhesion. Critical for print success. | 0.4mm nozzle: 0.24mm | https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/wiki/quality_settings_layer_height |
| Line Width Default | 105-150% | Based on nozzle diameter. Wider lines print faster and stronger. Narrower lines give finer detail. 110-120% is sweet spot for strength vs quality. Affects all print features. | 0.4mm nozzle: 0.42mm (105%) | https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/wiki |
| Line Width First Layer | 105-115% | Conservative width for reliable bed adhesion. Wider lines help bridge bed irregularities. Too wide causes over-extrusion and poor surface. Foundation for entire print. | 0.4mm nozzle: 0.44mm | https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/wiki |
| Line Width Outer Wall | 105-150% | Controls surface finish and dimensional accuracy. Narrower for precision parts, wider for speed. Most visible setting - directly affects print appearance and tolerances. | Precision: 0.4mm, Standard: 0.45mm | https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/wiki |
| Line Width Inner Wall | 120-125% | Can be wider since not visible. Improves strength and reduces print time. Balances structural integrity with speed. Affects overall part strength significantly. | 0.4mm nozzle: 0.5mm | https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/wiki |
| **Seam Settings** |  |  |  |  |
| Seam Position | Aligned/Back/Scarf | Controls where layer changes occur. Aligned creates straight vertical line, Back hides seam, Scarf eliminates seam visibility through overlapping transitions. Most important for surface finish. | Curved objects: Scarf seam | https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/wiki/quality_settings_seam |
| Scarf Seam | Enable for curved surfaces | Revolutionary OrcaSlicer feature that creates angled transitions between layers, virtually eliminating visible seam lines. Requires Inner/Outer/Inner wall ordering and proper flow calibration. | Enable with Inner/Outer/Inner order | https://www.obico.io/blog/orcaslicer-seam-settings/ |
| Seam Gap | 0-15% | Controls overlap between perimeter start/end points. Larger gaps reduce seam bulging but risk visible gaps. Well-calibrated printers can use larger values safely. | Well-tuned printer: 10-15% | https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/wiki/quality_settings_seam |
| **Precision Settings** |  |  |  |  |
| Precise Wall | Enable | Sets overlap between outer and inner walls to zero, dramatically improving dimensional accuracy without compromising strength. Essential for precision parts and tight tolerances. | Enable for dimensional accuracy | https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/wiki/Precise-wall |
| Arc Fitting | Enable (not Klipper) | Replaces short line segments with G2/G3 arc commands for smoother curves and smaller G-code files. Not recommended for Klipper due to processing overhead. Improves surface finish on curved surfaces. | Marlin: Enable, Klipper: Disable | https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/wiki/quality_settings_precision |
| XY Compensation | -0.1 to +0.1mm | Compensates for material expansion/shrinkage and extruder characteristics. Positive values enlarge parts, negative shrinks them. Use tolerance test prints to determine correct value. | Tight holes: +0.05mm | https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/wiki/quality_settings_precision |
| **Speed Settings** |  |  |  |  |
| Outer Wall Speed | 30-60mm/s | Most critical speed setting for surface quality. Slower speeds give better finish but increase print time. Balance quality requirements with time constraints. Visible surface quality depends on this setting. | Quality prints: 40mm/s | https://www.obico.io/blog/speed-test-in-orcaslicer-vfa-a-comprehensive-guide/ |
| Inner Wall Speed | 60-120mm/s | Can be faster than outer walls since not visible. Affects structural integrity and overall print time. Should complement outer wall speed for smooth tool path transitions. | Standard: 80mm/s | https://www.obico.io/blog/speed-test-in-orcaslicer-vfa-a-comprehensive-guide/ |
| Infill Speed | 80-150mm/s | Fastest print feature since internal and less critical for quality. Limited by volumetric flow rate and printer capability. Major factor in total print time reduction. | High-end printers: 120mm/s | https://www.obico.io/blog/speed-test-in-orcaslicer-vfa-a-comprehensive-guide/ |
| First Layer Speed | 20-30mm/s | Critical for bed adhesion success. Slow speed ensures proper layer bonding and accommodation of bed irregularities. Failed first layer ruins entire print regardless of other settings. | All features: 25mm/s | https://www.obico.io/blog/speed-test-in-orcaslicer-vfa-a-comprehensive-guide/ |
| **Wall Configuration** |  |  |  |  |
| Wall Count | 2-4 walls | Directly affects part strength, surface finish, and print time. More walls increase strength but slow printing. Minimum 2 for decent quality, 3-4 for functional parts requiring strength. | Decorative: 2, Functional: 3-4 | https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/wiki/strength_settings_walls |
| Wall Ordering | Inner/Outer/Inner | Print sequence affects surface quality and dimensional accuracy. Inner/Outer/Inner sandwiches outer wall for best surface finish and accuracy. Critical for precision parts. | Always use for precision | https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/wiki/strength_settings_walls |
| Top/Bottom Shells | 3-5 layers | Solid layers on top and bottom surfaces. More shells give stronger surfaces but increase print time. Must prevent infill show-through on visible surfaces. Layer height dependent. | 0.2mm layers: 4 shells | https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/wiki/strength_settings_top_bottom_shells |
| **Infill Configuration** |  |  |  |  |
| Infill Density | 15-30% | Balances strength, weight, and print time. Higher density increases strength but uses more material and time. Consider application requirements - decorative vs functional parts. | Decorative: 15%, Functional: 25% | https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/wiki/strength_settings_infill |
| Infill Pattern | Gyroid/3D Honeycomb | Pattern affects strength, flexibility, and print time. Gyroid provides isotropic strength ideal for stressed parts. 3D Honeycomb prints faster with good strength. Lightning infill for minimal strength needs. | Flexible parts: Gyroid | https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/wiki/strength_settings_infill |
| Infill Wall Overlap | 10-15% | Bonding between infill and walls. Too little causes delamination, too much causes over-extrusion. Critical for part strength - failed bond creates weak points in stressed parts. | Standard: 12% | https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/wiki/strength_settings_infill |
| **Support Settings** |  |  |  |  |
| Support Angle | 45-50° | Overhang angle requiring support. Steeper angles (lower numbers) need more support but ensure better quality. Consider printer capability and post-processing time when setting. | Most prints: 45° | https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/software/bambu-studio/support-painting |
| Support Distance | 0.2mm | Gap between support and part. Equal to layer height provides easy removal while maintaining support effectiveness. Too close bonds permanently, too far provides inadequate support. | 0.2mm layers: 0.2mm distance | https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/software/bambu-studio/support-painting |
| Support Type | Tree/Normal | Tree supports provide better surface finish and easier removal but may fail on complex geometry. Normal supports more reliable but leave marks. Choose based on part complexity. | Complex geometry: Normal | https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/software/bambu-studio/support-painting |
| **Advanced Features** |  |  |  |  |
| Adaptive Pressure Advance | Enable | Advanced feature that dynamically adjusts pressure advance based on flow rate, acceleration, and feature type. Provides superior quality across varying print conditions but requires comprehensive calibration. | Requires calibration | https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/wiki/adaptive-pressure-advance |
| Variable Layer Height | Enable | Automatically adjusts layer height based on model geometry. Provides smooth curves without sacrificing speed on flat areas. Excellent for organic shapes and detailed models with varying complexity. | Complex curves: Enable | https://www.obico.io/blog/orca-slicer-adaptive-and-variable-layer-height-guide-smoother-3d-prints/ |
| Monotonic Infill | Enable for top surfaces | Eliminates visible infill lines bleeding through top surfaces by ensuring consistent infill direction. Critical for professional appearance on visible top surfaces. Slight time penalty. | Visible top surfaces: Enable | https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/wiki |
| Input Shaping (Klipper) | Enable if available | Compensates for mechanical vibrations at high speeds by predicting and countering resonance frequencies. Enables much higher print speeds without quality loss. Requires firmware tuning first. | Requires firmware tuning | https://www.klipper3d.org/Resonance_Compensation.html |
