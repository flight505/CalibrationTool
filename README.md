# Orca Slicer Calibration Suite

A comprehensive web application for calibrating 3D printer settings in Orca Slicer. Features a beautiful, modern interface with dark mode support and guided calibration workflows.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Calibration Tools

1. **Temperature Tower** - Find optimal printing temperature for your filament
2. **Flow Rate Calibration** - Dual methods:
   - Cube Method: Precise measurement-based calibration
   - YOLO Mode: Quick visual calibration
3. **Pressure Advance** - Tune for sharp corners and better print quality
4. **Retraction Test** - Eliminate stringing with optimal settings
5. **Max Volumetric Speed** - Find your hotend's melting limit

### ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Guided Calibration Sequence** - Follow the recommended order with step-by-step instructions
- **Dark Mode Support** - Easy on the eyes during late-night calibration sessions
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
